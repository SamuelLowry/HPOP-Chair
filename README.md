### Howdy all!

HPOP has been my home at Harvard. From our times in Quincy to L166 and now to Zoom, I have deeply appreciated the community and been passionate about our mission—to voice the views of our generation. I am continuously blown away by you all. 

Over the past two semesters as a Research Team Leader, I have become familiar with the inner workings of HPOP. While what we have is fantastic, here are some ways I hope to help bolster our mission:

1. **Streamline scheduling and expectations**
- Besides our usual Sunday and Monday gatherings, HPOP meetings can be unpredictable in timing especially leading up to question finalization and press release. As Chair, I would create a master schedule each semester including additional meetings going into question finalization and press release and goals for every gathering.

2. **Improve data visualizations**
- Datawrapper is user friendly but also limited in scope. To better our visualizations and allow for further customization, I propose that we also utilize R. As Chair, I would create a style guide and hold R-based data visualization workshops.

3. **Increase our publication footprint**
- Our polls are rich with valuable data, but not all of it makes it into the press release. As Chair, I would expand our current publication arrangement with HPR so that if you have an issue you are passionate about, you would be able to easily get published.
- In addition, our national op-eds are often published weeks after our press release is buzzing in the media. As Chair, I would coordinate with IOP staff in order to publish a national op-ed in tandem with our press release to spread our message ourselves in a more widely accessible format.

I am always available at 616-928-5181 if you have any questions

Thank you, and I hope that I can count on your vote!
